  <h1>Store</h1>

  <p>
    My project is an e-commerce. For these first steps, I built this simulator that allows the user to select products from the store, products are categorized in different groups. 
    The idea was also to have a bit of control over the stock available and saving products into the shopping cart. Selected products are stored using <code>localStorage</code> in the browser.
  </p>

  <p>
    The user can choose different products and buy in bulk, always depending on the available stock.
    If you reload the website, you can either keep the previous cart or start from scratch.
  </p>

  <p>
    The entire experience is done through the <strong>console</strong>. 
    To start, open the console ( F12 or right click → "Inspect" → "Console") and reload the website.
